# Masks: A New Generation (Unofficial) Revised IN KOREAN

This module contains moves for the game Masks: A New Generation for use with the Foundry VTT generic PbtA System (https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta). You can install this system with this link: https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta/-/jobs/artifacts/beta/raw/system.json?job=build-beta

The content from this module is from **Masks: A New Generation** from **Magpie Games**. You can get the PDF at: https://magpiegames.com/masks/

This revised version of the module is based on the original created by brunocalado (https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial). In the update, the text of the moves has been slightly rearranged and every move has a custom icon from game-icons.net (https://game-icons.net/).

In addition, Compendium Folders (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earlSt1/vtt-compendium-folders/master/module.json) is a dependency for this version. If you do not already have Compendium Folders installed, you should be prompted to install it when installing this module.

This module is a prerequisite for Masks: A New Generation Sheets (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/masks-newgeneration-sheets). This module can be used without that one, but it is a great module and is highly recommended.

# Install

## Module Directory
This module is listed in the Foundry module directory and can be searched and installed within the application.

## Manual Instalation
Go to **modules** and use this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial-revised/main/module.json

# Templates
You need to set up a template before import the compendium. There are two you can use, but I suggest sticking with the normal sheet because that supports the Masks Sheets module referenced above.

- Normal sheet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial-revised/main/templates/masks.txt
- Harm sheet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial-revised/main/templates/masks_harm.txt

# How To

1. Choose a template and load that template in the settings of your PbtA game.
2. Activate the module.
3. Import the compendium you want. Right click it and Import all Content.
4. Drag the Folder Basic and Adult to an Actor Sheet.

# More Instructions
There is a journal with more instructions inside the module. Load the module and search the compendiuns for it.
